					<h2>Our Anthem</h2>
					<p>At Purpose Driven Executive, our goal is to bring balance, joy, and productivity to the marketplace. Our mission is to stir up and equip the world with the good news that the grind is fake, and that life is meant to be lived with purpose.</p>
					<p>We believe that ever person has a purpose. That every one of has magic that the world desperately needs to be released. We are committed to helping individuals be more than they could be...but who they should be. We believe that fear is the great limiter of mankind, and we will do whatever it takes to remove it in ourselves and our clients. </p>
					<p>We believe that every person has a set of innate gifts and talents, and that these were meant to bring profit in the marketplace, and blessing to others.</p>
					<p>We believe that work is NOT a grind. It is a beautiful part of life, when it is done right.</p>
					<p>We believe that a healthy work-life blend is essential to the individual enjoyment of life.</p>
					<p>There are MANY proven processes, but we believe that there is no ONE format for personal and marketplace productivity, and we will strive to help each person we come into contact with to find THEIR way.</p>
					<p>We believe in helping others, even if there is no financial reward.</p>
					<p>We believe that we are here to be givers, livers, lovers, and earners, and that we can help others reach their pinnacle in all areas of life.</p>
					<p>Most of all, we believe that we are here to draw out greatness in others to be everything they can be.</p>

					<h2>About Co-Founder</h2>
					<img src="tuttle_family.png">
					<p>Hi, I'm Donnie. You're here because I am a co-founder of Purpose Driven Executive. You can't understand Purpose Driven Executive without knowing a little about me.</p>
					<p>I am a man of Christian faith, husband of one wife for 25 years, and father of 8 children. I believe strongly that we were all made for a purpose, and it's our job to find it, and pursue it until it is reality. I have coached, consulted, and trained countless executives, I found that-contrary to popular thought-it is not always true that the harder one works the more success they would have. I believe that when we function in our gifts and talents, according to our unique "DNA", that work is easier, more enjoyable, and more effective.</p>
					<p>Life is not meant to be lived as one being chased. It is a purposeful journey.</p>
					<p>Personally, we decided to sell everything and travel the world as a family.  We travel the world, as a family encouraging others to find and live for their purpose.</p>
					<p>My one purpose in life is to help others to find out why they are here, and then equip them and hold them accountable to growth in that direction. To call out greatness in the process, and to help others walk in complete joy as they unleash the magic that is in them alone.</p>
